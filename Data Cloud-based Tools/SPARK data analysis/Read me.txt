- Spark Data Analysis Project
This project analyzes global land temperature data using Apache Spark. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project.

- Project Structure
GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv: The dataset containing temperature data.
Spark data analysis.pptx: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the analysis results.
SPARK.py: The main Python script for performing data analysis using Apache Spark.

- Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Apache Spark (version 3.0.0 or later)
Python (version 3.6 or later)
Java (version 8 or later)
Necessary Python libraries:
pyspark
pandas

- Setup Instructions

1) Install Apache Spark: Follow the official Apache Spark website instructions to download and install Spark.

2) Install Required Python Libraries:
Open a terminal and run the following commands to install the necessary Python libraries:

 pip install pyspark pandas

3) Set Up Environment Variables:
Ensure the environment variables "SPARK_HOME" and "JAVA_HOME" are set correctly. Add the following lines to your 
".bashrc", ".zshrc", or equivalent configuration file:

 export SPARK_HOME=/path/to/spark
 export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java
 export PATH=$SPARK_HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

Replace "/path/to/spark" and "/path/to/java" with the actual installation paths on your system.

4) Running the Spark Program:
Navigate to the project directory containing "SPARK.py" and run the script using Python:

 cd /path/to/SPARK_project/SPARK\ project
 python SPARK.py

- Script Overview
The "SPARK.py" script performs the following tasks:

Load Data: reads the CSV dataset into a Spark DataFrame.
Data Cleaning: Cleans the dataset by handling missing values and removing unnecessary columns.
Data Analysis: Performs various analyses such as calculating average temperatures, identifying trends, and visualizing results.



- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Ensure to have adequate memory and CPU resources to run the Spark job efficiently.
For detailed analysis and results, refer to the ppt file.
